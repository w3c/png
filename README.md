# Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification

This repository is for the maintenance of the [PNG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/png/),
the Second Edition of which was jointly published in 2003 by W3C as a W3C Recommendation,
and by ISO as an International Standard ISO/IEC 15948:2003 (E)
with identical contents. The Third Edition was published as a [**W3C Recommendation**](https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-png-3-20250624/) on 24 June 2025.

This repository is being used to work on an [Editors Draft](https://w3c.github.io/png/) of the Fourth Edition.

The [PNG Extensions specification](https://w3c.github.io/png/extensions/Overview.html) is also here.

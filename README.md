# Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification

This repository is for the maintenance of the [PNG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/png/),
the second edition of which was jointly published in 2003 by W3C as a W3C Recommendation,
and by ISO as an International Standard ISO/IEC 15948:2003 (E)
with identical contents.

This repository is being used to work on an [Editors Draft](https://w3c.github.io/png/),
and also for discussion and update of technical changes or additions.

A First Public Working Draft of the [Third Edition of PNG](https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-png-3-20221025/) 
was published in October 2022. ([Changes from Second Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/png-3/#changes-since-the-w3c-recommendation-of-10-november-2003-png-second-edition))
and [updated](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-png-3-20230720/) on 20 July 2023
([changes since FPWD](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-png-3-20230720/#changes-20221025). 

PNG Third Edition became a [Candidate Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-png-3-20230921/) on 21 September 2023 ([Changes since previous publication](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-png-3-20230921/#changes-20230720)). The latest Candidate Recommendation was from [13 March 2025](https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/CR-png-3-20250313/). See [Changes since previous publication](https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/CR-png-3-20250313/#changes-20250121/). It became a [Proposed Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/PR-png-3-20250515/) on 15 May 2025
and then finally, a [**W3C Standard**](https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-png-3-20250624/) on 24 June 2025.

There is an [Explainer](https://github.com/w3c/png/blob/main/Third_Edition_Explainer.md) for features new in the Third Edition,
and an [Implementation Report](https://w3c.github.io/png/Implementation_Report_3e/).

The [PNG Extensions specification](https://w3c.github.io/png/extensions/Overview.html) is also here.
